# Reporting for ASP.NET Core - Row-Level Filtering in an Application with SqlDataSource (Multi-Tenancy Support)

This example demonstrates how to restrict access at the row level to the source data based on the user who is logged into the system. Create and register a service that implements the [DevExpress.DataAccess.Web.ISelectQueryFilterService](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Web.ISelectQueryFilterService) interface. The [ISelectQueryFilterService.CustomizeFilterExpression](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Web.ISelectQueryFilterService.CustomizeFilterExpression(DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.SelectQuery-DevExpress.Data.Filtering.CriteriaOperator)) method applies a conditional clause to the query passed to the method as a parameter.  The **Document Viewer**, **Report Designer's Preview**, and **Query Builder** call the `ISelectQueryFilterService` service before the [SqlDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.SqlDataSource) executes a SELECT query.

## Implementation details

### Authentication

For ease of demonstration, this example uses a simulated user login (without actual verification) that allows your code to use this user's identity.

### User ID Retrieval

A custom `UserService` service processes the [HttpContext](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httpcontext) and retrieves the user ID.


### Security Filter

The `SelectQueryFilterService` service implements the [ISelectQueryFilterService](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Web.ISelectQueryFilterService) interface. The service calls the `UserService` service to get the ID of the user who is logged into the application.

The service's **CustomizeFilterExpression** method determines whether the query contains the specified tables, and adds conditional clauses that retrieve data rows where the `StudentID` column value matches the current User ID. 

Note that the `ISelectQueryFilterService` does not allow you to modify the query passed to the `CustomizeFilterExpression` method. The method returns the [CriteriaOperator](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.Data.Filtering.CriteriaOperator) that forms the WHERE clause for the original SELECT query.

### Connection String

The `QueryFilterServiceApp` connection string is stored in the secret storage, as Microsoft recommends. Review the following article for more information: [Protect secrets in development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets). The content of the `secrets.json` file is:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings:QueryFilterServiceApp": "XpoProvider=MSSqlServer;Server=(local);Database=QueryFilterServiceApp;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;Integrated Security=True"
}
```
The `RemoveXpoProviderKey` method converts the DevExpress XPO connection string to a connection string that Entity Framework can use.
